# Recognised party status

<p class="lead-text">
[‚Üê Elections in British Columbia](/elections)
</p>

A political party has **recognised party status**, also called official party status, if it has two or more seats in the [Legislative Assembly](/leg).

A recognised political party is not the same as a [registered political party](https://github.com/British-Columbia/Provincial-Court/wiki/Registered-Political-Parties-%E2%80%90-Information), though all recognised parties must be registered.

Recognised parties also need to meet requirements set out below. If a party doesn't have recognised status or it doesn't meet the requirements of recognised parties, its [members](/leg/members) are treated as independents.

The party which the Premier belongs to is called the **government party**. If there is a coalition, multiple parties may also be included as government parties.

The **official opposition party** is the largest non-government party. The leader of the official opposition party is called the **leader of the opposition**.

The term **opposition party** is also sometimes used to refer to any party that is not a government party.

## Roblox groups

Recognised parties must have a Roblox group. This group is used for things like role bindings and to identify party members.

> Non-recognised parties can also have Roblox groups. In fact, it's recommended.

This Roblox group needs to have at least one role (rank) that's *only* given to party members. Parties might have multiple member roles for different types of membership or for positions within the party.

Parties need a role for their leader and, if the party has one, a role for their whip.

    <summary>The full list of requirements for Roblox groups</summary>
    <p>

    Roblox groups are required for parties to be recognised per Group Oversight.

    * The name of this group must be similar enough to the party's name.
    * The party must have roles that is issued to MLAs in it. This role can also be used for all party members. There can be multiple roles for this (e.g. party officers, such as chair or president).
      * For greater clarity, role bindings for parties will be set as `member of legislative assembly AND has any one of the roles specified for this point or the whip/leader role`
    * The party must have a role for its leader.
    * If the party is required to have a whip or if it optionally decides to have one, a role for that.

    These group roles will be used to populate information (e.g. in the Legislative Assembly Discord server). For this reason, the purpose of the designated roles (members, whip, and leader) should rarely be changed but their rank numbers, names, etc. can be changed at will.

## Caucuses

A party caucus is a formal group of its Members of Legislative Assembly. Only recognised parties have caucuses.

### Leaders

It's recommended that only MLAs lead recognised parties.

The leader of any government party and the leader of the opposition must be an MLA.

### Whips

Government parties and the official opposition party must appoint one of their MLAs to be Party Whip. Smaller opposition parties can also decide optionally to appoint one of their MLAs to be whip.

The leader of a party may also serve as whip, but this isn't recommended. If there is no whip or they are unavailable, their responsibilities fall on the deputy whip or the leader.

Whips help manage business in the house (the Legislative Assembly) on behalf of their party, including overseeing the caucus and reporting to the party leader.

> Parties can appoint one of their MLAs to serve as deputy whip. This isn't generally recommended unless a party is sure it's necessary. Remember, leaders can also fulfil the duties of whip.
