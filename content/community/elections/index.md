## Voting

### General elections

A general election is an election for every single member of the [Legislative Assembly](/leg).

**How to vote**

In general elections, you receive two ballots.

On the first is a **list of candidates** alongside their party affiliation. You can vote for up to a set number of candidates. Each vote counts the same, there is no ranking.

:::tip
The maximum number of votes you can cast in the first ballot is the number of candidates elected through that ballot (vacancies). In general elections, this is usually **four**.
:::

On the second ballot paper is a **list of parties** and a list of candidates standing for that party. You can only vote for one party. A vote for a party is a vote to make more of their list of candidates into Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs).

You do not have to vote on either ballot, but this will "spoil" the ballot. Spoiled ballots are counted, but do not count towards any candidate or party.

> You can vote on the candidate (first) ballot but spoil the party (second) ballot, or vice versa. You can also spoil both ballots.

**How it's counted**

The candidate (first) ballot papers are counted first. Seats are awarded to individual candidates based on which candidates got the most votes.

> If there is a tie between candidates, it's usually broken by [drawing a random lot](https://github.com/British-Columbia/Provincial-Court/wiki/Electoral-Regulations#breaking-ties).

The second (party) ballot papers are then counted. The people counting look at how many individual candidates a party won. They then add 'additional members' from the party lists to make the Legislative Assembly match how the province voted on the party ballot.

    <summary>How are the party results calculated?</summary>
    <p>

    **Stage 1**

    Take the number of individual candidate seats the party won, and add 1.

    If they got 0 seats on the first ballot, the number is 1 (0 + 1).

    If they got 4 seats, the number is 5 (4 + 1).

    You then divide the party's second ballot **vote total** by that number. This gives you the party's **adjusted votes**.

    The adjusted votes are what you use to decide who has won at this stage.

    At stage 1 you will do this for all the parties.

    Whichever party has the highest number of **adjusted votes** after this stage gets the first additional seat.

    **Stage 2**

    You will only need to calculate one adjusted votes total at this stage: for whichever party just won an additional seat.

    Add in their new seat to the formula **seats + 1**, and divide their **vote total** by that number. You now have their new **adjusted votes** total.

    Whichever party has the highest number of **adjusted votes** after this stage gets the next additional seat.

    **Repeat Stage 2 until all remaining seats** (usually six) **are allocated.**

    **Stage 3**

    Now you have a number of additional seats for each party. Go through each party's list and pick the top candidate from that list who hasn't already been elected, that person gets a seat. Repeat until all of the additional seats have been allocated or there's no more places on the list.

    Any seats not filled (e.g. a party wins four additional seats but only submits three names) will be contested at the next by-election.

    </p>
</details>

This voting system is called the [additional member system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional-member_system) (AMS) using the 'Modified dâ€™Hondt Formula'. It's similar to mixed-member proportional (MMP), but with a few minor differences. Both AMS and MMP are used in real-life parliamentary democracies.

:::tip
MLAs do not lose their seats if they change, leave, or get removed from their party.

### By-elections

A by-election is called when there are vacant seats in the Legislative Assembly. They might not be called when a seat becomes vacant, and could be called a few days or weeks later.

If a by-election has four or fewer vacancies, it's only ran using the first (candidate) ballot. This system is called [plurality at-large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_block_voting).

If a by-election has more than four vacancies, it's ran using the same method as general elections, just with fewer seats. Four candidates will be selected using the candidate ballot, and any remaining vacancies will be filled using the party ballot.

## When do general elections happen?

The Constitution Act requires that a general election is held "no later than 153 days following the previous general election". In practice, general elections are held every four months.

The Lieutenant Governor can call a general election at any time. This is usually on the advice of the Premier, but the [Lieutenant Governor can reject their advice](https://archive.ph/NsIrb).

A general election is always called if a [**vote of no confidence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence#Canada) passes in the Legislative Assembly (or a vote *of* confidence fails) **and** no party can put forward a Premier who has the confidence of the Legislature.
