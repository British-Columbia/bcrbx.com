# Organisation page standards

This page outlines the standards for organisation home pages. It does not include additional pages within an organisation's directory (folder).

## Structure

Organisation pages do not need to begin with any summary or lead text; they can start with a heading.

Organisation pages could include the following sections (headings), in no particular order:

- What we do — Recommended, especially as the first section. No more than a paragraph summarising your department.
- Recruitment or jobs
- Our documents — For example, linking to complaints forms or public databases

The second heading usually needs to be *Our management* (which is discussed in detail below).

## Social links

Below the department name, on the right-hand side, are two social links:

- BC Social
- Discord

These links are optional but recommended. You can only have one link per platform.

In the case of ministerial departments, the BC Social link may point to the BCPS account if the ministry has no specific account.

If you have both English and French language social accounts, only the English one should be linked.

## Featured people

The featured people section, usually called *Our management*, is used to showcase the most senior leaders within your organisation. People are featured using the full-width `KeyPerson` element or using the four-column `GridPerson` element.

In ministerial departments, the minister and deputy minister will be featured using `KeyPerson` and any Asoc/Asst DMs should be featured using `GridPerson`. Where there is only an associate deputy minister and no assistant deputy ministers, directors and similar roles may also be featured using `GridPerson`.

In non-ministerial departments and agencies, the department head will be the only person featured using `KeyPerson`. Other senior leaders may be featured using `GridPerson`.

> **Exception**: Owing to RCMP's unique structure, both the commissioner and deputy commissioner are featured as — akin to ministers and deputy ministers — considered department head.

A decision will have already been made as to who is featured and in what way; contact Automationeer if you want this reviewed. It is your responsibility to [let us know](/publishing#contacts) if there are structure or personnel changes.
