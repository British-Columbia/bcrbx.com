BC Social is a Mastodon server, it's a bit like Twitter. Mastodon servers can link up to other servers (this is called federation or the fediverse), but that's disabled here. This means it's basically a private Twitter clone, just for us.

## Getting an account

This is currently an alpha service. In the future, it'll be easier to create and manage accounts. In the mean time, accounts must be manually approved. Include in the reason for joining your Roblox username, or - for a business account - a link to your trading licence.

For personal accounts, it's recommended that you make an account under your current or a past Roblox username, but this isn't a rule. **You can't change Mastodon usernames once your account is made.**

For the time being, it's your responsibility to figure out what email address will be used, password, etc. In the future, all Mastodon accounts will use a 'sign in with Roblox' feature and let you allow multiple people to access an account that way. But this site is still new.

Your email address will be visible to site admins (i.e. Group Oversight). Don't use an email address with personal information.
