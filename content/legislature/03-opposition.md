# Opposition

The importance of opposition in the Westminster tradition of parliamentary government has long been recognised. The opposition party with the most seats is known as His Majesty's Loyal Opposition (or the Official Opposition), which indicates that although the opposition may be in disagreement with the government, they remain loyal to the [Crown](/gov/lieutenant-governor).

The Official Opposition takes the lead in holding government accountable for its policies and actions. Its leader becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition and occupies the seat directly across from the Premier in the Legislative Assembly.

If at least two MLAs are elected from the same party, they receive [official party status](/elections/recognised-party-status). This gives the recognised party the same privileges as other recognised parties and allows them to fully participate in parliamentary business.

While they may not have all of the privileges granted to the Official Opposition, [Independent Members](/leg/members/independents) play a very similar role in holding the government to account.

## Leader of opposition parties

The Leader of the Official Opposition is, by custom, accorded certain rights and privileges. These include a seat in the front row of the Chamber, extended speaking time when participating in and debating the [Address in Reply](/leg/throne-speech#address-in-reply), as well as in responding to ministerial statements.
