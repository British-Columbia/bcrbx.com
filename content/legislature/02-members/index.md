# Members of the Legislative Assembly

In British Columbia's Parliament, elected officials called Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) meet to shape the future of the province.

When the Legislative Assembly is in session, an MLA's job is to represent the voters that elected them and collaborate with other MLAs to govern the province.

Differences in priorities and values on how to best govern B.C. often result in MLAs running for office under different [political parties](/elections#political-parties) or as Independents. MLAs representing different political parties will compete with each other to govern the province. The party with the support of a majority of MLAs will become the government, while the remaining MLAs will form the opposition. This relationship between the government and the opposition shapes much of the work that MLAs do in the Assembly.
