# Independent Members

Occasionally, a person who is not a member of [political party](/elections#political-parties) is elected as an MLA, becoming an Independent Member. Independent Members act on behalf of their constituents independent of any party affiliation.

Sometimes an MLA changes party affiliation. They may choose to sit as an independent or as a member of a different party. This is known as "crossing the floor" or "defection".
