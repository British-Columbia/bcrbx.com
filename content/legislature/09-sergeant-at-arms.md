# Sergeant-at-Arms

The Sergeant-at-Arms is a permanent officer of the Legislative Assembly and is responsible for the ceremonial aspects of the Legislative Assembly and for its security.

The ceremonial role of the Sergeant-at-Arms involves carrying the mace and walking at the head of the procession that escorts the Speaker, followed by the Clerks, into and out of the Chamber at the opening and closing of the each sitting.

When the Legislative Assembly is sitting, the Sergeant-at-Arms or a deputy is always present in the Legislative Chamber and acts on the instructions of the Speaker in the event of any disorder in the Chamber, the lobbies and corridors, or the public galleries.
