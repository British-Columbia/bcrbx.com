# Clerk of the House

The Clerk of the Legislative Assembly is the senior permanent office of the Legislative Assembly. The Clerk is non-partisan and must have no bias for or against any political party.

The primary role of the Clerk is to interpret the Standing Orders, conventions, precedents, and usages in order to advice the Speaker and MLAs on parliamentary procedure. The Clerk is at service of the Legislative Assembly and all of its Members, regardless of party affiliation. All MLAs must be listened to and advised with utter objectivity and confidentiality. Like the Speaker, the Clerk must accord equal treatment to every MLA in order to preserve a reputation of impartiality.

After either a general election or by-election, the Clerk administers the Oath of Allegiance to every elected Member, including those who have been re-elected. They must swear the oath or make an affirmation before taking their seat in the Assembly. The Clerk also presides over the election of the Speaker.

In addition to procedural responsibilities, the Clerk is responsible for the preparation and printing of the Orders of the Day and the Votes and Proceedings. They are the custodian of all records and other documents of the Assembly and have custody of proposed legislation throughout its stages and proceedings.

The Clerk, on the Speakerâ€™s behalf, also has extensive administrative functions. These include the direction and control of the various departments of the Legislative Assembly in their day to day operations. These departments include the Office of the Clerk, the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms, and Legislative Assembly Protective Services.
