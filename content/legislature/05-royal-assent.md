# Royal Assent

Once a law has been passed by the Legislative Assembly, it goes to the [Lieutenant Governor](/gov/lieutenant-governor) for his or her royal assent. Once granted, the bill is printed by the [King's Printer](https://github.com/British-Columbia/Kings-Printer/) and becomes law (an act).
