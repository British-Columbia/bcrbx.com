## What we do

We are mandated by law to protect British Columbia from serious threats and to help in the prevention and detection of serious crime, such as dealing. We work with the Ministry of Justice and law enforcement agencies to disrupt these threats.

The CSIS Act is a comprehensive law which sets out the powers CSIS has and provides clear limitations on when they can be used and how. We ensure that our operations are always lawful and proportionate.

CSIS employees are not police officers and do not have powers of arrest. We do not publicly comment on the identities of our staff, and officers are told to be discrete about who they share information their employment with. We do this to ensure that our informants, our intelligence and our investigations are kept secure.

## Contact us

:::info
If you have information on dealing or other serious activities that fall within our mandate, we want to hear from you!

> **The identities of informants are classified and cannot be divulged in court without the informant's consent.** Within CSIS, all of our employees are highly vetted, but we still take steps to protect the identities of informants from our own staff.
:::

The only way to contact CSIS is via the enquiries form or by direct messaging the Director. The form is most preferred.

Further details on how the form works can be found on the home page of the enquiries form.
