# Government organisations

There are four types of government organisation:

- Ministerial departments, which are headed by a [cabinet minister](/gov/cabinet) and a non-political [deputy minister](/gov/cabinet/deputy-ministers). The people who work for these are usually part of the [BC Public Service](/gov/public-service). Ministers report directly to the Premier.
- Non ministerial departments, which are headed by a professional department head, such as a director or chief. Non ministerial departments report directly to the Premier.
- Agencies, which are headed by a professional department head. Agencies usually report to a minister, but occasionally the Premier.
- Crown corporations, which are government owned businesses. Crown corporations are more independent from government than departments or agencies, but their chief executive is usually appointed by the Premier.

Independent bodies are not part of government, but are included on this page for completeness. Some independent bodies may have their heads appointed by the Premier.
