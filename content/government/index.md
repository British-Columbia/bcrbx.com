# Government

The Government of British Columbia is responsible for managing the affairs of the province through policies and laws. It is divided into three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial.

## Executive branch

In B.C., the Executive branch consists of the [Lieutenant Governor](/gov/lieutenant-governor) and the [Executive Council](/gov/cabinet), led by the Premier.

The formal element of the executive branch is His Majesty King Charles III, who is the legal head of state of Canada. The Lieutenant Governor represents the King in British Columbia. Executive government in B.C. is vested in the Lieutenant Governor acting by and with the advice of the Executive Council.

The political executive is composed of the Premier and Cabinet, who together run the government. In our system of parliamentary democracy, governments are formed by [political parties](/elections#political-parties) who have the confidence of the [Legislative Assembly](/leg), meaning that a majority of [MLAs](/leg/members) support the government. Two types of government in British Columbia are:

- A **majority government**, which results from a general election where one political party wins the majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly
- A **minority government**, which results when a governing party does not win the majority of seats in a general election, but is able to maintain the support of a majority of MLAs

If the leader of a party is supported by the majority of MLAs, they are normally asked by the [Lieutenant Governor](/gov/lieutenant-governor) to form a government by taking office as [Premier](/gov/premier).

The Premier is the president of and appoints people to the Executive Council, which is also known as the [Cabinet](/gov/cabinet). Cabinet ministers are often tasked with running government ministries. They are responsible [individually](/gov/ministerial-responsibility) and [collectively](/gov/cabinet-confidence) for government.

To ensure that this power is not abused, there are many practices that are used to the hold the government accountable. This accountability is foundational to parliamentary democracy and is exemplified in both the individual and collective responsibilities of Cabinet ministers and in the parliamentary proceedings adopted by the Legislative Assembly.

## Judicial branch

The Premier, on the advice of the Chief Judge, appoints judges to the [Provincial Court](/courts). The Lieutenant Governor, as the King's representative, personifies the law and constitution. The Royal Coat of Arms is affixed above all courts of British Columbia to represent the King's authority, and the history of the monarchy in legal justice.

## Legislative Branch

The Legislative branch, officially the Parliament, is made up of the Lieutenant Governor (again, representing the King) and Members of [Legislative Assembly](/leg). When a law is passed by the MLAs, it is 'assented' to by the Lieutenant Governor.
