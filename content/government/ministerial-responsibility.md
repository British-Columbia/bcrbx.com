# Cabinet confidence

[Cabinet ministers](/gov/cabinet) have both individual and collective responsibilities to the Legislative Assembly. The principle of individual ministerial responsibility holds that ministers are accountable not only for their own actions as head of government ministries, but also for the actions of their subordinates.

All government ministries, agencies, boards, and commissions, except [non-ministerial departments](/gov/organisations#non-ministerial-departments), operate under the direct authority of a Cabinet minister. Therefore, almost all government activity is carried out in the name of a minister who, in turn, is responsible to the Legislative Assembly for the actions and performance of those organisations. Ministers exercise considerable decision making power and are constitutionally responsible for the provision and conduct of government.

The Legislative Assembly holds them both personally and [collectively](/gov/cabinet-confidence) accountable for it. Individual ministerial responsibility provides the basis of accountability throughout the system.
