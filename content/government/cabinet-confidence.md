# Cabinet confidence

Everything that goes on in [Cabinet](/gov/cabinet) is confidential. All ministers must take an oath of solidarity declaring they will not reveal confidential Cabinet discussions. Cabinet confidence ensures that the [Crown](/gov/lieutenant-governor) is advised by Cabinet ministers who can freely consider and discuss all options before they make a collective decision.

Cabinet ministers also adhere to the principle of collective ministerial responsibility. Each minister is expected to take responsibility for and defend all [Government](/gov#executive-branch) decisions. Even if there is disagreement amongst Cabinet members about a decision, once it is made, every Cabinet minister must support and defend it or resign from their role. This principle provides stability within teh framework of ministerial government by uniting the [responsibility of individual ministers](/gov/ministerial-responsibility) under the collective responsibility of Cabinet and the Crown.
