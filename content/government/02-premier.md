The Premier acts as the head of government for BC. In other words, they are the first minister and chief officer of the executive branch. [Section 45 of the Constitution Act](https://github.com/British-Columbia/Kings-Printer/blob/main/Laws/Constitution%20Act/Consolidated.md#office-of-premier) also designates him or her as chief diplomat, responsible for overseeing international relations.

The Premier appoints [cabinet ministers](/gov/cabinet), who are in charge of ministries in the public service, and oversees a range of other government officials.
